# Our Story

It all started in 2023, when a group of friends from Morrovalle (MC), in the Marche region of Italy, decided to transform the garden of a private villa into something magical: an electronic music festival unlike anything else.

What began as a party among friends evolved into one of the most exciting independent festival realities in the Marche scene. In just a few editions, we went from a crazy idea to an event that attracted over 6,500 people, united by their passion for electronic music and the desire to live a unique experience.

The name "Pablo" comes from our parrot mascot, who immediately became the symbol of the festival. Each edition has a theme that transforms the garden into an immersive world, where scenography, lights, and sounds create an unforgettable atmosphere.

# The Editions

**2023 — Pablo Edition**
The first edition, entirely dedicated to our parrot mascot. The garden filled with tropical vibes, vibrant colors, and the contagious energy of those who believe in a dream. The beginning of everything.

**2024 — Jungle Edition**
Pablo migrated to the jungle. Dense scenography, exotic sounds, a total immersion in a wild and fascinating sonic ecosystem. The party got bigger, more intense.

**2025 — Flower Edition**
The garden bloomed. Floral aesthetics, colorful stage design, an explosion of life and beauty. Nature and music merged in a perfect embrace.

**2026 — Sweet Edition**
Candies and sweetness take over the garden. The most delicious edition yet, where every corner smells like sugar, pastel colors, and candy shop vibes. Get ready for a sweetness overdose.

# The Team

We're a passionate group of friends from Morrovalle who believe in the power of music, community, and creativity. We're not a corporation, we don't have unlimited budgets. We're people who put their hearts into what they do.

What unites us is the desire to create something unique for our territory, to prove that even from a small town in Marche, an event that leaves its mark can be born. Every edition is the result of months of work, sleepless nights, crazy ideas, and so much passion.

# Our Mission

Promote electronic music as an art form, not just entertainment. We want Pablo The Garden to be a reference point for emerging and established artists, a stage where musical quality comes first.

Enhance the territory of Morrovalle and the Marche region, demonstrating that culture and creativity can flourish anywhere, if there's the will to build something together.

Create a welcoming community space where people can feel free to be themselves, dance, connect, and live experiences that go beyond music.

Prove that an independent festival can be both ambitious and authentic, without compromising on quality or identity.
